# The Full Test
This is a full test of what an ideal Markdown file should look like.

It includes **emphasized text**, *italicized text*, and ~~strikethrough text~~.
You'll also find [links](https://google.com), ![images](https://cdn.sierrasoftworks.com/logos/icon.ico), and `inline code`.

```json
{
   "inline codeblocks": true
}
```

> And quotes too!

Let's also not forget about tables

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |

- Maybe some lists for good measure too?
